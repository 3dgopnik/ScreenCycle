# Rest screen

The refreshed full-screen rest mode now highlights the remaining time and adds a playful touch to the wait.

## What you see

- Your custom rest message pinned to the center of the display.
- A large digital countdown timer formatted as `MM:SS`.
- A bubbly progress bar with rounded corners that fills up as the rest phase winds down.

## How it behaves

- The timer and progress bar update every second from the cycle service broadcasts.
- Text and progress colors follow the selected RestTheme so the screen always matches your palette.
- As soon as the REST phase ends the screen closes automatically, handing control back to the user.
